# Screentime Calculator

I despise how much social media consumes us. This helps you keep track of how much precious time we waste wired to our screens.

## How it works

Input the amount of days you wish to calculate

```Days to calculate > 7```

It will then ask you for your minute value over your day value:

```
Enter daily minute value > 43
Enter daily minute value > 23
Enter daily minute value > 45
Enter daily minute value > 56
Enter daily minute value > 60
Enter daily minute value > 26
Enter daily minute value > 31
```

You are left with your result.

```Your average screentime is 41 minutes```
